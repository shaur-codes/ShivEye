# Let's come to the point

- I tried to block porn in every way possible from installing browser extensions, using every free pornblocker to creating another user account in my PC and using Microsoft family safety to protect myself from watching porn and blocking it network wide from my router by configuring DNS etc.

## The Problem

so mainly there were two problems

### Problem with Microsoft family safety (I'll call it MFS for now)

- it was working pretty fine sometimes it worked better than other extensions while blocking the adult sites but some of the piracy sites (for movies etc.) also provide adult content and unfortunately, MFS wasn't able to detect it also those sites keep changing their domain names (for example they'll change their URL from XYZ.world to XYZ.fit) every few days, so even if I block one URL they are gonna change their domain name and at the end, one can download adult content from there and MFS (MFS) doesn't has an option to block the web page having explicit words or they don't even have any option to block a website from its name itself like I can't block a website just by entering XYZ that has a name XYZ.world and that site keep changing its domain name to something other.

- one more problem with MFS is that it blocks lengthy URLs, so sometimes when I am trying to visit a site with long URLs they get blocked and that's irritating TBH.

- and damn... there were times when I needed to give administrator privileges to run an application and I was frustrated making my mom enter the password for the admin account every time I had to run cmd.exe as admin.

### Problem with browser extensions 

if you have a problem with porn or (maybe not then also...) you maybe searching for something or maybe just surfing on quora or anything else, and this small thought about sex, full of curiosity came in your mind and you searched for it... or maybe an image just appeared that you found arousing and then just 5 seconds after that moment your brain is done releasing those hormones - Dopamine (naam to suna hoga...), Noradrinaline, the one responsible for taking an action and many others...

- If one ever wanted to watch porn they can simply disable them and watch porn

- you know instagram :), it has pornographic images and videos, I mean a lotttt... of source of adult content whether it be in a form of an image, video or link for those kinda content on cloud storage (Mega etc.) you can get such kind of images even more intense on quora that we expect is a platform for sharing openions, experience,facts and knowledge.

so the extensions weren't able to block them in my case (neither was MFS able to block it)

### Concluding problems

- as mentioned in the second point of Problem with browser extensions, the solution can be blocking instagram right? but imagine... what if you are a content creator

- using MFS or extensions will limit you from accessing a lot of things, sometimes those things can be necessary things online on the internet or on your device.


## Solution

IF you have read "the problem" part you should understand that this is a flaw that should not be handled by checking if the XYZ.fit has NSFW content or not, they might be directing you to some other site, or it can be an 18+ movie containing pornographic scenes.
Or maybe some social media site has this kind of content...

####so it should be handled graphically.

let me tell you what I mean... what if somebody's parents are sitting next to them will that person be able to watch porn? NO not even by mistake XD.


- so the Idea is to make a program that can monitor the graphics that one is seeing on their screen and then take the actions accordingly.



### How this program should works?

- It will monitor the graphics that are seen by the user and if their is any nsfw content played either on a media player, or on a browser or any other app say- whatsapp desktop it will immidiately get the PID of the program that is playing that NSFW content and then quit that program, followed by a warning that NSFW content was detected and therefore X program has been terminated. If NSFW content is detected on a browser our tool just need to terminate that single tab only.

- the program modifies some host/registry files during installation that the user can't uninstall the program (cold turkey blocker modifies some host files to do so)
- the program must autostart and the user shouldn't be able to disable this functionality by changing registry or anything else.

- so in this case if the user tries to watch NSFW content on internet the tab will be closed on the browser, if he tried to download and watch it on media player it will be terminated, the user can't uninstall the program.

## vision

- the vision is to create a free pornblocker that blocks porn for real and help teens in conserving their vital energy to think and grow the way they should be growing, living a happy life, a healthy friend circle, a teen age full of nice memories and adventure and make their life worth living so that they may not regret on their Death Bed. : )
